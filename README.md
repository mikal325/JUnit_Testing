# JUnit_Testing
When testing my code to ensure that it is working properly, and as intended, I perform a JUnit test.  The JUnit test ensures that the program will work as intended by entering in the values, and testing all possible combinations of the tested block, i.e., if testing if a value is less than to 5.  If the value being checked is 4, the Unit test will inform me that it is true.  If the value is 5, and it comes back true, then there is an error, in the code, because 5 is not less than 5.
I incorporate user needs, by reading and or listening to their user stories.  I take notes, and ask them questions (if applicable).  Before writing a program, I also read their stories aloud, because then I will hear other issues that come up, that might have been missed when reading the stories, silently.  After reading the user stories, I write down a plan and put it into action.  While gathering thoughts and opinions from my peers on the user stories, and how I planned to execute them.
I approach designing software by making a sketch of how the program is supposed to look.  Making notes on design choices, and finding the best place to start when starting a project.  Finding a place to start is sometimes the hardest part, but after that the rest of the program falls into place.  I also make sure to test my programs to make sure there are no bugs, and logic errors in the program.
